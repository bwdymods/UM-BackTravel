#### BackTravel is a mod for UnderMine that allows fast travel to previous zones via the Cartographer (as opposed to only traveling to later zones). It could easily be considered unbalanced; balance is something that will be explored in the later versions.


# Features

* When fast traveling via the Cartographer, you will now have access to previous cleared zones instead of only later zones.
* You will arrive at a new instance of the previous zone, not the one you already cleared and looted.
* Requires UnderMod 1.0.0.0 or newer.
* Notably, as there is no Map for the Goldmines, the Cartographer does not offer travel there, or to the Hub.
